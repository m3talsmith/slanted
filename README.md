Slanted
=======

A slightly different take on polls.

Requirements
------------

1. Mongodb
2. Ruby 2.0

Install
-------

This should work with either rvm or rbenv.

``` bash
cd slanted
bundle install
```

To test the functionality, run the specs:

``` bash
rspec spec
```

If all is well simply run the server and you're off to the races!

``` bash
rails s puma
```
